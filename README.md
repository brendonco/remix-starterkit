# Simple Remix Starter Kit

Remix has a fancy `npx create-remix@latest` thing you can run (which is much easier than what I'm going to do.). We're going to skip that and build a simple remix app from scratch.

- To build project `yarn build`.
- To start project in dev mode `yarn dev`.
- To start project in production mode `yarn start`.

And if we open that up, we'll see it's working perfectly!
